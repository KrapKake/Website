        <p>As society comes ever closer to a dystopia, one must ask oneself the important questions, the questions that determine the priority of certain things in one’s life. These are the questions whose answers are the saving grace for some and the blow of death for the others. These are the questions whose answers decide what shall be left behind in the dirt, and what shall rise like a phoenix from the flame, enduring all that was thrown at it in the process of the world being mangled by the iron jaws of tyranny. “Philosophizing vs. Engineering”, “Idealism vs. Pragmatism”, “Minecraft vs. Fortnite”; questions like these determine the direction humanity will head in, and whether it will liberate itself from those iron jaws. When it comes to “YouTube vs. Newpipe”, I have chosen my side. Though the dystopia is inevitable, one can seek to delay it, which is why I side with Newpipe. It is the new coming of the light and shall push back against the evil that is YouTube for a long time to come, so long as we support it and are there to help it walk the path of light, to pull it back when it strays off the beaten path. Come, my friend, join us.</p>

        <p>As I listen to a mathematician analyze a Minecraft YouTuber’s speedrun, I think to myself, “Is this the most productive I can be?” And as I begin to reflect upon this question, I try to recollect how I got to this point. The last thing I remembered was being separated from my parents and put into a small cramped room. The people who put me there told me that all I had to do was to look at a screen, and so I did. But I never recalled time passing by so fast; had it really been 20 years?</p>
