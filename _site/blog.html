        <p>As I listen to a mathematician analyze a Minecraft YouTuber’s speedrun, I think to myself, “Is this the most productive I can be?” And as I begin to reflect upon this question, I try to recollect how I got to this point. The last thing I remembered was being separated from my parents and put into a small cramped room. The people who put me there told me that all I had to do was to look at a screen, and so I did. But I never recalled time passing by so fast; had it really been 20 years?</p>
