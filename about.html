      I'm a cosmic deity also known as 'The Transcendent Flesh'. I have come to this planet to create software. I wish to live the
      life of an Earthling simply because destroying life on galactic scales simply isn't meaningful anymore. I am a consoomer; both of galaxies, and 
      of crappy internet content.
      <br>
      I specialise in AI/ML but am learning Web and Native app development.
      <br>
      I use Arch btw, and am learning to switch to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
